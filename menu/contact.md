Hi! I am Ally Smith and I am a senior at Davidson College. I major in Computer Science and minor in Data Science. I created this website for my final project in my Human Computer Interaction course. Through this class, I realized how much I enjoy the design process. I have always been interested in visual art. I think HCI, web desigin, product development and more combine CS and art in an intriguing way. If you have any questions about my projects, you can email me at alsmith@davidson.edu.
