# Design Sprints

Design Sprints are group projects where we follow the design process to create a specific kind of product. Through this course, we designed website, data visualizations, VR experiences, and physical visualizations. Summaries and links to the projects are list below in order of when we completed them.

## Design for Dimensions

We learned how to design for a target user group by re-designing Knotty&Board's website to fit 3 different screen sizes. We created personas to identify our users, drew many sketches, received feedback on our ideas, and made our final prototypes on Figma.

## Design for Understanding

We investigated the difference between analytical and persuasive data visualizations. We brainstormed analytical and persuasive visualizations for a Movie dataset using the Five Design Sheet method. Then, we coded our finalized designs using CSS and HTML.

## Design for Another World

Based on a survey we sent out to Davidson College students, we created a VR skydiving experience. The user skydives above Davidson's campus, deploys their own parachute, and lands on Chambers Lawn.

## Re-Design and Extend

To further understand the design process, we needed to learn about re-designing products and ensuring they are accessible. So, we created physical visualizations of our Design for Understanding data visualizations that are accessible for visually impaired or blind users.
