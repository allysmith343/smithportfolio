Throughout our design process, we prioritized a user-centered approach, ensuring that our designs catered to the specific needs, abilities, and preferences of our target user groups. From creating personas to conducting surveys and usability testing, we used diverse methods to understand our users and design with them in mind. Our process involved brainstorming extensively, analyzing data thoroughly, seeking feedback iteratively, and incorporating universal design principles to enhance accessibility. This reflection highlights how these practices shaped the development of our projects, resulting in meaningful and user-friendly products. Throughout this course, we developed a variety of products, yet I believe the following five key points encapsulate the essence of a successful design process for any type of product.

## Understand Target Users
Throughout the design process, from beginning to end, we needed to focus on the [target user group](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nQvmNzbUI3KnNwkuFJlBy6Q8O51kJqxu/view). In Design for Dimensions, each group member created a persona detailing a potential Knotty & Board customer. When we brought the three personas together, we brainstormed features we wanted the website to include based on the target users’ needs, abilities, and current problem points. For example, our personas struggled to imagine how furniture or decor pieces would fit and look in their homes. Therefore, we created a feature where users can upload a picture of their room and select an item from the website to see how it fits in or matches their room. Furthermore, our persona Debby focused on whether the pieces matched. So, we added a “Suggestions” area that would use AI to find furniture and decor pieces that matched her room. Finally, all three personas focused on affordability. As a result, we made sure users could insert a price range to only see items they could afford. Using our personas and focusing on our target users, we were able to design a more useful website on three different screen sizes.

We also focused on our target user group in Design for Another World. As we brainstormed ideas on how to create our VR skydiving experience, we wanted to better understand who could possibly use our product and what they would like to see. Therefore, we sent out a survey to Davidson students asking them the following questions: 
1. Are you scared of skydiving? Why or why not?
2. Are you interested in going skydiving? Why or why not?
3. Where would you like to skydive? What would you see while skydiving there?

We found that many respondents were interested in skydiving, but were too scared to actually follow through with it. So, our product could be a way for people to test out skydiving without the real dangers. It could also be useful for professional skydiving training or for users who cannot skydive in real life for health, financial, or other reasons. The final question helped us determine where users may want to skydive above or land. Because we sent our survey to Davidson students, we received many Davidson-focused answers such as Chambers Lawn, top of Wall, and the football stadium. Therefore, we built a model campus that users would skydive above and land on Chambers Lawn. Through our survey and gathering information about our user group, we determined how to design our VR world and how our product could be useful.

## Understand the Data
Completely understanding and utilizing data to its fullest are key in designing the best products. In Design for Understanding, we dove into a dataset about movies. This dataset included movies from over a hundred years ago, worldwide, and from many genres. We created both analytical and persuasive data visualizations based on this dataset. As a result, we had to first completely understand the dataset and what we could portray with it. We began by investigating how large the dataset is, figuring out outliers, and thinking of ways to consolidate the data. At first, nearly 1 million film productions were included in the set, containing sports games and other productions that were not movies. Therefore, we took non-movie entries out as well as set a threshold of $1,000 for both budget and revenue. Along with this, the dataset allowed for each entry to be a part of multiple genres. So, we chose the 8 most prevalent genres and filtered out movies that did not fall into one of them. As a result, we cut our data down from nearly 1 million entries to 10,000, allowing for better data visualizations. By understanding our dataset completely, we used it to its full potential to create more comprehensible and impactful [data visualizations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdSZJzb-aX8).

We also needed to interpret data relating to the target user group and feedback. As mentioned above, in Design for Another World, we gathered user data through a survey. By interpreting that data, we understood that many possible users are afraid of skydiving, but are interested in it. We also made design choices based on the data we collected with the survey such as landing on Chambers Lawn. In each of the Design Sprints, we gathered feedback from people about our designs either from general comments or usability testing. For Re-Design and Extend, we conducted usability testing on the data visualizations for Design for Understanding. We gave four people tasks to complete and took notes on how they completed the tasks and if they were successful. After interpreting this data, we designed our accessible physical visualizations. We made design decisions based on survey data and usability test data to create better products for our users.

## Brainstorming
Throughout the design process, we brainstormed many ideas that we sketched out and combined to create a final product. In Design for Understanding, we used the [5 Design Sheet](https://kawilliams.github.io/teaching/hci/papers/RobertsHeadleandRitsos-FiveDesignSheet.pdf) methodology to create our final data visualizations. The first sheet is an overview of the dataset and many miniature sketches that we combine and refine. Using the first sheet, we make three sheets that expand on miniature ideas. The fifth sheet combines the ideas of the four sheets to form a final design. This methodology ensures we understand the data, brainstorm many ideas, and create a product that is user-friendly and represents what we want it to.

In Design for Dimensions, we drew over 30 sketches. While brainstorming, it was important to have a high quantity of ideas at first to have a good base to build off of. During the design process, it was beneficial to brainstorm individually and then combine ideas as a team afterward. It was also helpful to surround oneself in the context of the product, understanding how it will be used and who will use it. Overall, our brainstorming approach enabled us to balance creativity with practicality, resulting in designs that effectively addressed user needs.

## Feedback & Evaluation
As we designed products or interfaces, we received feedback in multiple forms. We asked for general feedback, did heuristic evaluations, and conducted usability testing. In Design for Dimensions, we asked peers to look at our initial sketches, taking note of what they liked and any suggestions they had. Through this general feedback, we combined sketches and changed some features to create our final sketches and then our Figma prototypes. After we had our prototypes created, we did both heuristic evaluations and usability testing. A classmate followed Jakob Neilson’s 10 [Heuristics](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-to-conduct-a-heuristic-evaluation/) to see if our interfaces followed the guidelines. The main suggestion was to have more error prevention and a clearer way to return to the home page. Also, we conducted usability testing by asking people to search for a furniture item and see what it looked like in their room. Participants were able to complete the tasks quickly and understood how to use our interface. The main suggestion was to have a clearer way to add items to the cart or check out. In a single project, we received feedback in three ways, paving the way for future improvements and a better user experience. 

In Re-Design and Extend, we conducted two [usability tests](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/usability-testing-101/). As mentioned above, we asked four individuals to complete tasks on the data visualizations we created for Design for Understanding. Based on those results, we designed accessible physical visualizations. When we constructed those, we conducted another round of usability testing on the physical visualizations. We asked five individuals questions that they could answer using the physicalizations. As they found the answers, we took note of how they found them and if they were correct. It was interesting to compare how participants completed the tasks using data visualizations versus physicalizations. If we had more time and materials, we would use the results of the usability testing to make our physicalizations even more accessible and useful.

## Universal Design & Accessibility
The final point that defined my design process is accessibility. As someone from a family dedicated to helping people with disabilities, I am passionate about furthering accessibility initiatives and proactively creating accessible products and places. In Re-Design and Extend, we created physical visualizations that were accessible to visually impaired and blind users. We ensured our physicalizations were accessible by including the following:
* Braille labels
* High contrast between the text and the background
* Large, bold lettering
* Tactile Discrimination using pipe cleaners, puffy paint, and yarn
* Users can compare items based on weight

Even though we focused on making our products accessible to visually impaired users, our design choices could help all users better understand our data. [Universal design](https://web.mit.edu/6.813/www/sp18/classes/18-accessibility/) creates a product that can be accessed and used to its full extent by all users regardless of age, size, ability, or disability. Designing accessible products is beneficial to all users because they are easier to use through a better tolerance for error, an intuitive design, and little physical effort required. 

While reflecting on our design sprints, I realized we could have focused more on accessibility during the design process. For example, we designed the Knotty & Board website for a large multitouch display in Design for Dimension. We should have placed the top menu bar at the bottom of the page. This would ensure users who are in wheelchairs, users who cannot reach up, or shorter users can still access the features. Furthermore, utilizing Section 508, the Web Consent Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) from the W3C Accessibility Initiative, or the WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool would have ensured our interfaces followed accessible design guidelines.

## Conclusion
By focusing on our target users, analyzing data, brainstorming collaboratively, and incorporating feedback, we created designs that were thoughtful, functional, and inclusive. Each step of our process, from persona development to final evaluations, underscored the importance of understanding and addressing user needs. By incorporating elements of accessibility and universal design, we ensured our products could be utilized and appreciated by a diverse audience. These experiences not only helped us refine our designs but also solidified the importance of empathy, creativity, and iteration in creating impactful solutions. These points defined my design process throughout this course and will continue to define it as I explore HCI more in the future.
